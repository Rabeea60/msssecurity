                                As a manager of a venue in the Northern Quarter I have to rely on the support of good staff to ensure the venue runs properly.With the door staff being the most important part at front of house it is essential to have a good team. I have always been happy with the quality of work from MSS and would and have recommended them to everybody. Knowing the door staff put the safety of both staff and customers before all else is of upmost importance and something I have not found with other companies. We have used MSS for the past 4 years and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. With 24 hour support from a fantastic management team and late requests always covered at short notice I find MSS to be the best and most professional company around. </p>

                            <p>The Community Lettings Team began employing MSS Security approximately 12 months ago to provide door supervisors for social events at Trafford Councils’ managed community buildings. It was gratifying and reassuring to know that all the security staff provided were often local, tailored to meet the needs of the individual customer, screened and Security Industry Authority (SIA) registered.

                            <p>The Managing Director, is very approachable and provides an excellent, professional and high quality service. There have been times when we have turned to MSS in an advisory capacity and found them to be extremely supportive.

                            <p>When door supervisors are ‘booked’ for social events, we know that the staff will be smartly presented and more importantly we can depend on the service provided. Another key aspect of the service is the competitive and affordable rates, which is an added bonus, as it took us some time to find a Company that could meet our security needs, especially in sensitive circumstances. We have no hesitation in stating our satisfaction with the services provided by this company and highly rate them.
